<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I created a portfolio document to showcase my proficiency in using SQL, with a specific focus on employing AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter information. This document was a crucial addition to my cybersecurity portfolio, aimed at demonstrating practical skills in database querying and analysis. To fulfill the project requirements, I first reviewed the scenario provided, which was linked to a recent lab exercise on SQL operators. Subsequently, I meticulously documented the queries executed during the lab, providing clear explanations of their purpose, the involved tables, and the criteria used for data filtering. Moreover, I illustrated the practical application of these queries in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, emphasizing their relevance in threat analysis, incident response, and data management. After compiling all the insights into a professional portfolio document, I ensured its clarity, coherence, and completeness through a thorough review process. This project not only enhanced my understanding of SQL querying techniques but also equipped me with a valuable resource for future job interviews and career advancement opportunities within the cybersecurity field.
